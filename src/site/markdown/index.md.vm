Description
-----------

  This `accumulo2-maven-plugin` allows your Maven project to run a mini,
  single node instance of Apache Accumulo 2.x in order for you to run your
  project's integration tests against a live version of Accumulo.

Getting Started
---------------

  To add this plugin to your project, configure the plugin similarly to:

```xml
  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>${project.groupId}</groupId>
        <artifactId>${project.artifactId}</artifactId>
        <version>${project.version}</version>
        <configuration>
          <instanceName>it-instance-maven</instanceName>
          <rootPassword>ITSecret</rootPassword>
        </configuration>
        <executions>
          <execution>
            <id>run-plugin</id>
            <goals>
              <goal>start</goal>
              <goal>stop</goal>
            </goals>
          </execution>
        </executions>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
```

  and build your project, similarly to:

```
mvn verify
```

The `start` goal typically runs at the `pre-integration-test` phase, and the
stop goal typically runs at the `post-integration-test` phase of the [Maven lifecycle][1],
so your project will have access to the running Accumulo instance during the
`integration-test` phase to perform its integration tests.
